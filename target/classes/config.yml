# Default configuration for CheeseFactory
config_version: 3

# Note on custom_id:
# - If custom_id.type is set to another plugin (e.g. nexo, craftengine), CheeseFactory will keep that plugin's
#   item name, lore, and appearance. The name/lore entries in this file only apply to minecraft items or when
#   falling back to a vanilla material because the external item could not be created.
# - custom_model_data is per-item: set it inside each item's section here (for ingredients) or inside cheese.yml
#   (for cheeses). If you omit it or set it to 0/negative, that item will not use custom model data.

bacteria:
  # NOTE:
  #  - Bacteria block drops are NOT controlled by this config.
  #  - Install RoseLoot and configure a BLOCK loot table to drop this bacteria item
  #    (for example by running 'cf give bacteria 1' or by dropping an item matching this definition).
  #  - See RoseLoot wiki: https://wiki.rosewooddev.io/RoseLoot/overview/
