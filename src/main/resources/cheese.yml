# Default cheeses for CheeseFactory. You can add or remove cheeses here.
# Names and lore below apply when custom_id.type is minecraft or when the plugin falls back to a vanilla item.
# If you point custom_id.type to another plugin (for example nexo or craftengine), the external item's metadata
# is kept as-is and CheeseFactory only tags the item for its own use.
# To use a resource pack model for a cheese, add `custom_model_data: <number>` under that cheese. If omitted or <= 0,
# no custom model data is set for that cheese.
